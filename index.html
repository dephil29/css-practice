            <hr>
            <p>It was a gloomy, Wednesday afternoon many generations ago when Jane Doe and John Smith had grown tired of all their stuff. All of their stuff was too complex and diverse. They missed the days when all their stuff was simple, predictable, and
                comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>Jane had the bigly idea to "make stuff great again" &reg;, like it used to be when she was younger. Then next day, Jane and John began creating what everybody knows today as "Make Stuff Great Again."</p>
